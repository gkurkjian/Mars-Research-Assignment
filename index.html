            <p>The Mars or the <q>Red Planet</q> which other way to describe the planet Mars is the second smallest planet in our <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/">solar system</a> after Mercury taking place on first. It has similarity and proximately into our planet the Earth, which gives some indications and a slight possibility of life in it.</p>

            <p>​Mars has sandy, frigid desert with a thin atmosphere. Seasons, polar ice caps, dead volcanos, and indications that it was once far more active make Mars a dynamic planet.</p>

            <p>In this this summary research we will talk about the Possibilities and Difficulties of life on Mars.</p>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>In Billions</em> of years age, Mars used to look very similar to Earth, there were certainly similarities between Mars and Earth. The Scientists believe that Mars once had a huge ocean. Experts estimate that this ocean covered more of the planet's surface than Earth's oceans now do.</p>
            <p>Even in extreme conditions and under hard circumstances, the life on Earth can thrive. Therefore, life may be found in some of the world’s most remote locations. Furthermore, life on Earth is possible in the hottest and direst desert. In addition, life is also occurring in extreme cold Antarctica continent. Importantly, this tenacity of life provides a great deal of optimism for life on Mars. </p>
            <p>The reason of the possibility of life on Mars is that, before the Mars was much warmer than now. Because it is includes a water and warm temperature therefore the two major requirements are included and has a possibility for life continuation in it.</p>

            <h4>Confrontation and Difficulties to Live in Mars</h4>
            <p>There's slight issue on the Mars is gravitational pull. Most notably, Mars has a gravity that is 38% percent that of Earth. Low gravity can also lead to health issues such as muscle loss and bone demineralization.</p>

            <p>One of a big issue on Mars is its climate. The temperature on Mars is far lower than on Earth. The average surface temperatures of Mars are between 87 and 5 degrees Celsius. In addition, Antarctica has the lowest temperature on the planet at 89.2 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Mars lack from scarcity of water. The water on the Mars is actually lesser than the water on the direst desert on Earth.</p>
            <p>Also, approximately no grass or any plants or creature can survive the harsh conditions on Mars' surface. This is owing to the tremendous harshness of the environment on Mars' surface. </p>

            <p>Another issue is that Mars's temperature is colder than the Earth.</p>
            <p>All in all, life in Mars subject has lots of interests among scientists and specialists. Therefore, building life on Mars it contains lots of challenges, power and micro-researches with days and years. With hard working and unity, humans could have a chance to move a life on another earth like Mars and continue to thrive and boost life</p>
